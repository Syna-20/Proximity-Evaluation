# social-distance-detector

A social distancing detector built with OpenCV using YOLO(COCO model) object detector

<h2> About</h2>	
<p>
Social distancing is a method used to control the spread of contagious diseases such as the COVID-19 Disease. It implies that people physically distance themselves from one another, reducing close contact, and thereby reducing the spread.
</p>


## Features:
* Object detection using the YOLO COCO model to detect only people in a video stream.
* Computes the pairwise distances between all detected people.
* Based on the computed distances, we determine whether social distancing rule is being violated or not.


## Installation:

1. Clone the repo

```

2. Install dependencies

```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the social-distance-detector.ipynb
